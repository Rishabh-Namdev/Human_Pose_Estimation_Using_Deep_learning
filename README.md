## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishabh-Namdev/Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Deep_learning.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Deep_learning
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To run the project, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the pose estimation process on the test images provided in the `test` directory.

## Dataset

Include information about the dataset used. If the dataset is publicly available, provide links and instructions on how to download it.

## Model

Describe the deep learning model architecture used for human pose estimation. Include details about the layers, activation functions, and any pretrained models utilized.

## Training

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

## Evaluation

Explain how to evaluate the model's performance. Provide metrics and methods used for evaluation.

## Results

Showcase some results of the pose estimation. Include images with detected poses and any quantitative metrics.
